# Easy Permissions

An extremely simple and lightweight android library that helps you with Android Runtime Permissions.

---

## Usage:

### Adding the depencency

Add this to your root *build.gradle* file:

```
allprojects {
		repositories {
			...
			maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }
		}
	}
```

Now add the dependency to your app build.gradle file:

```
compile 'com.github.marcoscgdev:EasyPermissions:1.2'
```

### Request permissions

```
String[] permissions = {EasyPermissions.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE, EasyPermissions.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, ...};
int requestCode = 0;
EasyPermissions.requestPermissions(activity, permissions, requestCode);
```

### 

```
@Override
public void onRequestPermissionsResult(int requestCode, String[] permissions, int[] grantResults) {
    super.onRequestPermissionsResult(requestCode, permissions, grantResults);
    for (int i = 0; i < permissions.length; i++) {
        String permission = permissions[i];
        int grantResult = grantResults[i];
        if (permission.equals(EasyPermissions.WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE)) {
            if (grantResult == PackageManager.PERMISSION_GRANTED) {
                Toast.makeText(MainActivity.this, "WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE Granted", Toast.LENGTH_LONG).show();
            }
        }
    }
}
```
